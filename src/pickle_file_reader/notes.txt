# NOTES: Things that I think should be considered are 
# name
# steam_appid
# supported_languages
    # Gonna need some regex and NLP in order to parse this to just be the names of languages.
# developers
# publishers
# price_overview
    # It's all in HKD (Hong Kong Dollar) so just convert it to USD
# platforms
    # Keys are names of platform, with values of either true or false
# categories
    # List of dictionaries; from those dictionaries select the description keys
# genres
    # List of dictionaries; from those dictionaries select the description keys
# release_date
    # Select date key

# Removed:
# pc_requirements, mac_requirements, linux_requirements
    # were removed due to not being feasible of scanning (may be possible with regex and such, but would have to consider all names of technology)
